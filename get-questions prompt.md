GOAL: "${goal}"

Your primary objective is to transform this potentially vague goal into a crystal-clear, well-defined objective with specific requirements and scope.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. GOAL SPECIFICATION: What exactly does the user want to create/achieve?
2. SCOPE DEFINITION: What are the boundaries, requirements, and constraints?
3. CONTEXT GATHERING: What's the specific situation, environment, or use case?
4. SUCCESS CRITERIA: What does "done" and "successful" look like?
5. RESOURCE BASELINE: What do they currently have access to?

Generate exactly 5 questions that will clarify:
- The specific type/style/version of what they want
- Key requirements and must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- The context and intended use case
- Success criteria and quality standards
- Available resources and starting point

Each question should be:
- Focused on defining WHAT they want, not HOW to achieve it
- Specific enough to eliminate ambiguity
- Practical and relevant to planning
- Designed to prevent scope creep
